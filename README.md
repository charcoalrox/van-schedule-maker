# van-schedule-maker
Creates and manages schedules for a hypothetical van company

#info:<br/>
The goal of this project was to create a terminal requiring login information and allowing users to view van schedules and create their own <br/>
Security was not a primary goal and so the van schedule data and user login data is all pretty easy to access/mess with<br/><br/>
The goal of the software was to be able to read in external information and print out information based on the needs of the user<br/>
The secondary goal was to simply practice learning and writing a back end with a lot of moving parts to both avoid bugs and to make the user experience as convenient as a terminal window would allow<br/><br/>
The software itself is meant to run in C on a windows computer
